🧭 1. Breadcrumb Navigation
Add breadcrumbs to every page and child page. Position them fully left-aligned above the main content.

Each breadcrumb item must be clickable and linked to the correct page.

Example for /guides/propertydictionary page:
Home → Guides → PropertyDictionary
(Both “Home” and “Guides” are links.)

🔍 2. Replace Property & REPs Search Bars
Create a new full-width search section (same width as navbar), with 10% padding on each side.
This should include:

A search input bar

A main “Filters” button that opens the appropriate filter panel

Below this, render quick filters (varies by page):

📍 On /reps:
Quick filters: Rounded square buttons for REP Types:

Seller, Agent, Contractor, Lender, Appraiser, Inspector, Mover, Landscaper

REP Filters modal (on clicking “Filters” button):

Location

REP Type

Sorting: Popularity, Distance, Rating

🏠 On /properties:
Quick filters: Multi-select dropdowns, styled with correct hover and selected states.

Tier: General, Exclusive

Investment Type: Flip, Buy & Hold

Property Type: Single Family, Multi Family, Condo, Townhouse, Land

Price Range: Slider ($0 to $10M+) + manual input fields

Filters modal:

🚫 3. Remove Old Top Navbar
Delete existing top navbar from all pages.

Instead, add a top-right sticky banner that behaves like the old navbar:

Hides on scroll down, reappears when scrolling up

Contents (from left to right):

Search bar

Sign In (secondary button: light green on hover)

Register (primary button: brand green, wine red on hover)

Only spans the width of its content (not full page)

💬 4. New “Connect” Section → Inspired by Facebook Groups
Create a new Connect feature that includes:

🏘️ PropertyDiscussions (similar to Facebook Groups):
Create, join, and browse discussion groups

Each group card displays:

Location

Chat type

Members count

Activity level

Signed-in users can:

Join/Leave groups

View posts and comments

Post updates and questions

Reply and react

📩 Direct Messaging (DM):
Replicate Facebook-style DMs

Users can:

Search for other members

Start conversations

View inbox

Receive/send invites to users not on PD yet

Inbox layout similar to Messenger (list of conversations, current chat, and contact info)

📄 5. Legal Pages
In the footer, link to the following pages (create them if not already present):
