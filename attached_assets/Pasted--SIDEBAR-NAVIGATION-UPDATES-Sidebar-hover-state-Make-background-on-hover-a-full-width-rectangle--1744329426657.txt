🧭 SIDEBAR NAVIGATION UPDATES
Sidebar hover state:

Make background on hover a full-width rectangle with no rounded corners.

Highlight background with brand’s dark green (#09261E) and instant color transition.

Sidebar logo:

Replace with the new pdLogoalt.png provided (use current logo file in project).

Increase its size and reduce padding/margin to center it vertically.

Chevron:

When sidebar is collapsed, show a small chevron inside a rectangle that peeks out of the left edge (to guide users it’s expandable).

This chevron should disappear when sidebar is expanded.

🧱 TOP NAVBAR BEHAVIOR
Align content (search bar, Sign In, Register) fully to the right.

Navbar scroll behavior:

On desktop: scrolls out of view when scrolling down, reappears when scrolling up.

On mobile, the top nav should be sticky at all times, never scroll out of view.

On mobile view:

The hamburger should open the same sidebar, overlay style (like desktop).

Tapping outside the sidebar closes it entirely.

PD logo should appear to the right of the hamburger in the top bar.

🔍 SEARCH + FILTER BAR STICKINESS
For both /reps and /properties pages:

The search bar and filter buttons should be sticky (stay fixed at the top when scrolling).

On mobile, replicate Kaggle-style UX for filters:

Horizontally scrollable filters under the search bar.

Filters button opens a dropdown/modal with tags and sorting.

🎛️ FILTER BUTTON STYLING
On both /reps and /properties (desktop):

Display quick filters as styled buttons beneath the search bar.

Match Kaggle's rounded filter buttons, but make ours slightly less rounded.

On hover, highlight buttons using brand salmon accent color (#E59F9F).

Maintain a clean modern design, minimal borders, with slight shadow or lift on hover.

🔄 UNIFY SEARCH/FILTER UX ACROSS PAGES
Ensure /properties page search bar + filter layout exactly matches /reps, both on mobile and desktop.

Properties Filters:
Below the search bar, show the following custom quick filters:

Tier:

General, Exclusive

Investment Type:

Flip, Buy and Hold

Property Type:

Single Family, Multi Family, Condo, Townhouse, Land

Price Range:

Horizontal meter or blank fields: $0 — $10M+

Allow user-defined input boxes or sliders.

Filters button should still open a modal with tag-based multi-select filters (styled like Kaggle’s).
