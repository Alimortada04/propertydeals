üí¨ 1. Sticky Post Composer
Make the post creation box sticky so it stays visible as you scroll the feed.

Users should never have to scroll back to the top to post.

Mimic Twitter/X behavior: the post box floats above the feed and is always accessible.

If media is attached (image or video), treat it as the main content:

It should take center stage visually (like X posts).

Media fills the post card width with caption underneath.

üîî 2. Community Interaction Layer
A. Notifications System
Add a bell icon in the top-right of the banner/nav.

Clicking the icon should show:

New replies to your posts

Mentions

Follows

Likes/Reactions

B. Inbox & Messaging
Add a Direct Message inbox with support for:

Threads with individual users

Option to search users and start new threads

Real-time chat experience, like Facebook/Discord

Inbox should be accessible from:

The left sidebar (Connect or dedicated Messages tab)

Banner profile dropdown or top-right icon

C. Pinned Threads
Add the ability for admins/mods to pin posts to the top of a discussion category

Pin indicator + ‚ÄúPinned‚Äù label on feed card

Support multiple pins per category

üñºÔ∏è 3. Media Handling Improvements (continued)
When a user clicks on an image or video:

Open a media viewer modal

Support scrolling/swiping through other media in the feed (Reddit-style gallery)

Modal includes:

User info

Caption

Reactions

Timestamp

üìê 4. Layout Responsiveness & Content Flow
A. Content Positioning
Ensure no content is ever covered by the collapsed sidebar:

Content should start to the right of the collapsed sidebar at all times.

Maintain the current behavior where expanding the sidebar does not push content ‚Äî it simply opens over the page.

B. Desktop Sidebar Behavior
When sidebar is collapsed:

Show icons only (as it is now)

When expanded:

Sidebar overlays content (not pushing it)

Smooth animation preferred

C. Mobile Navigation Overhaul
Remove current floating hamburger icon.

Instead, make the banner a full-width horizontal navbar on mobile.

Place a new hamburger icon on the far left of this banner.

When tapped:

Opens the same sidebar menu as desktop (expanded view)

Menu should cover the screen, slide from the left.

Tapping outside the menu collapses it automatically

Ensure full responsiveness for all mobile screen sizes.

‚úÖ Summary
These improvements will:

Deliver a seamless posting experience like modern social apps.

Support engagement via reactions, messages, and notifications.

Fix layout and spacing issues across all devices.

Unify navigation UX for desktop and mobile.
