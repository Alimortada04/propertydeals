🧭 Sidebar Navigation (Left Menu)
Keep the selected menu item’s background as the primary dark green (#09261E).

On hover, use the light timberwolf color (#D8D8D8) instead of green.

The side menu should not push the page content when it opens. It must overlay on top of content like Kaggle’s sidebar (page layout should stay static).

In mobile view, the hamburger menu is not currently opening the sidebar. It should:

Trigger the same sidebar as desktop

Overlay it on top of the page

Fully collapse (disappear) when clicking outside the sidebar

When the sidebar is expanded, it should:

Show the full "PropertyDeals" text next to the logo

Use the same logo image as when collapsed (we're no longer switching images)

🧱 Top Navbar
Keep top navbar very minimal and clean

Right-align the contents (search bar, Log In, Sign Up)

The search bar should be positioned flush-right, next to the auth buttons

🗂 Properties & REPS Pages — Sticky Search + Filters
✅ General Sticky Behavior
The entire search + filter section should be sticky at the top of the page.

Eliminate any vertical gap between this sticky section and the top of the viewport.

🔄 Scroll Behavior
When scrolling down the page:

The search bar should hide

The quick filters should remain sticky

The filters container should expand to full width (stretching edge-to-edge across the page)

When scrolling back up:

The search bar reappears

The container returns to its original centered width

📱 On Mobile
Use a design like Kaggle’s mobile layout:

Sticky filter bar should be small, clean, and easy to tap

Filter dropdown should be mobile-friendly and open in a full-width modal

🎛 Filters (for Properties & REPS Pages)
Filter Container
Use dropdown-style filters similar to Movoto

Dropdowns:

Tier (General, Exclusive)

Investment Type (Flip, Buy & Hold)

Property Type (Single Family, Multi Family, Condo, Townhouse, Land)

Price Range (Slider from $0 to $10M+, with manual input boxes)

Quick Filters (Under Search Bar)
Quick filters should be shaped like rounded rectangles, not ovals

Selected filters:

Highlighted or outlined in primary green

Hover state:

Background or outline changes to light gray

Hovering over selected filter:

Shows an × (close icon) on the right

Clicking removes the filter

Filters Button
When hovering over the Filters button:

It should automatically open the filters modal/dropdown

Background on hover should be light green (#135341), not salmon

🗺️ Properties Page: Grid vs Map View
Remove the current list view

Support only:

Grid view

Map view (like Redfin Milwaukee Map View)

Map View
Split-screen layout:

Left half: Property cards

Right half: Map with property pins

When hovering over a map pin:

It should highlight the corresponding card

Display a floating preview card with basic info and a button to open that property’s page
