✅ 1. Seamless Post Creation Experience
Redesign the post flow to replace the current "Create Post" button with a persistent, always-visible post composer at the top of the feed:

Place the post input box directly at the top, styled like:

Twitter’s “What’s happening?”

LinkedIn’s “Start a post…”

Input box should include:

User avatar

Placeholder: “Start a discussion…”

Expands to full composer on click

Expanded Composer Should Include:
Title field (optional)

Main content (rich text or markdown)

Media upload:

Support up to 4 images or 1 video

Preview thumbnails before posting

Drag & drop or click-to-upload

Tag type selector (Discussion, Question, Resource, Deal Alert)

Dropdown to choose category (from sidebar)

Optional location tag

Action buttons:

“Post” (Primary CTA)

“Cancel”

Character counter (optional)

Loading spinner on submit

UX Behavior:
After submitting:

Post is inserted live at the top of feed

Input is cleared

If user is not logged in:

Clicking input opens login modal

🧵 2. Feed Design & Structure (Reddit/X-Inspired)
Clean card layout with clear titles, body preview, tags, and media.

Metadata below each post:

Author avatar + name

Post type tag (Discussion, Deal Alert, etc.)

Time posted

Reactions: 👍 ❤️ 🔥

Replies count

Share & Bookmark buttons

Comments & Replies:
Replies appear in expandable thread format (nested if needed)

Allow:

Rich text

Inline image/video replies

Sorting by: Newest, Most Liked, Most Helpful

📸 3. Image/Video Handling
In Feed:
Media should render inline (like X or LinkedIn)

Videos autoplay (muted) and pause on click

Captions should be styled clearly under media

Image Modal:
When an image is clicked:

Open full-screen modal with carousel support:

Swipe between media posts in the feed (not just single post gallery)

Show:

Poster’s name/avatar

Timestamp

Caption

Tags

Navigation:

Arrows for desktop

Swipe for mobile

“X” to close modal

Retain scroll position on close

Optional: pinch-to-zoom (mobile)

📱 4. Mobile Optimizations
Add a floating “Start a Discussion” button on mobile (bottom right)

Composer should adapt cleanly to mobile dimensions

🔎 5. Search & Filters
Maintain current left sidebar category filters

Add search bar at the top of /discussions feed

Add filter dropdown on right side of search:

Sort by:

Most Recent

Most Active

Most Liked

Filter by:

Tags

Categories

Location

🧠 6. Community Layer
Allow following posts or following authors

Add a sidebar widget for:

Suggested Topics

Trending Tags

Recommended Contributors

✅ Summary
The new /discussions experience should feel like a hybrid of:

Twitter (inline media, seamless posting)

Reddit (discussion threads, categories)

Discord (group feel and fast interactions)

LinkedIn (professional formatting)

The goal is to foster real estate collaboration and visibility in an approachable, dynamic way — enabling users to:

Share deals

Ask strategic questions

Offer resources

Connect with other REPs
