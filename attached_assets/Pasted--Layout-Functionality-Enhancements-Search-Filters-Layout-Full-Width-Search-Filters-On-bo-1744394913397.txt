🧭 Layout & Functionality Enhancements
🔍 Search & Filters Layout
Full Width Search & Filters

On both the /properties and /reps pages, make the search and filter section span the full width of the screen.

It should no longer be limited to the width of the catalog section below it.

/reps Page Padding & Consistency

Match the margin and padding of the REPS search section to be identical to the properties page.

This ensures consistency in spacing, layout, and responsiveness.

Filters Button on Properties

Add a "Filters" button to the end of the search bar on the /properties page, matching the one from the /reps page.

Clicking it should open a modal or dropdown with the following filters:

Location

Investment Type

Property Type

Price Range (Slider with $0–$10M+ and manual input boxes)

Tier

Seller

Size

Beds

Baths

❓ New Help Section
Under the sidebar’s Resources, add a new section labeled “Help” (icon: ?).

This will include cards linking to the following pages:

FAQ – A page with expandable accordion-style frequently asked questions.

Suggestions

Users can submit suggestions.

Users can upvote/downvote other suggestions (use a placeholder voting system for now).

Report a Problem

A page to report bugs or technical issues.

Include fields for title, description, and optional screenshot upload (placeholder).

📚 PropertyDictionary Expansion
Please update the /guides/propertydictionary page with a complete, searchable, and paginated list of real estate terms and definitions based on the uploaded PDF:
“Real Estate Terminology.pdf”.

🛠️ Requirements:
Import all terms and definitions from the provided PDF (no exclusions).

Display them in a clean list format, alphabetized A–Z.

Include a search bar at the top of the page to search by keyword or partial term.

Each term should be bolded, and the definition should follow in a clean paragraph block.

Add pagination (e.g., 25 terms per page) if needed for performance and clarity.

💡 If you want to add filters by first letter (A–Z), that would also be helpful for navigation, but optional for now.

This will be one of the core educational tools on the site, so it must be easy to navigate, scalable, and searchable.
