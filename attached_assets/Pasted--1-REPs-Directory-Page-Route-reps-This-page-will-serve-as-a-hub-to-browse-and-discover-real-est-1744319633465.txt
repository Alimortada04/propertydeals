‚úÖ 1. REPs Directory Page
Route: /reps

This page will serve as a hub to browse and discover real estate professionals. The layout should be clean, modern, and responsive, using TailwindCSS and maintaining the same visual identity as our current pages.

üîπ Design Details:
A full-width sticky navbar remains at the top (already implemented in the project).

Beneath the navbar, create a tabbed interface with four tabs, each showing a filtered list of REPs based on their type.

üìå Tabs (These should act as filters for different REP types):
Sellers

Contractors

Agents

Lenders

Clicking on each tab should dynamically update the visible cards below to show only REPs of that type.

üß© REP Cards (Shown inside each tab):
Each REP is displayed as a card component in a responsive grid (2 columns on mobile, 3 on tablet, 4 on desktop).

Each card should include:

Circular Avatar (use a placeholder image for now)

Full Name (bold text)

REP Type (small tag or label)

Location (City, State)

1-line bio or tagline (keep short)

A "View Profile" button that links to /rep/[slug] (profile page)

‚úÖ 2. Individual REP Profile Page
Route: /rep/[name]

This is the full profile for a single REP, similar to a ‚Äúteam member‚Äù or ‚Äúuser profile‚Äù page. Use a clean, centered layout with proper padding, consistent with the rest of the site.

üìå Profile Layout:
Hero section with:

Large avatar (centered)

Full Name (large bold text, League Spartan)

REP Type (label)

Contact Info:

Phone (with icon)

Email (with icon)

Location: City, State

About Section:

‚ÄúAbout Me‚Äù heading

Paragraph with placeholder bio

Dynamic Section Depending on REP Type:

If REP is a Seller:

Section for Current Properties (pull from mock property data)

Section for Past Deals (simple cards)

If REP is a Contractor:

Section for Active Jobs

Section for Past Projects

If REP is a Lender or Agent, just include an About section and Past Deals/Clients.

Use Tailwind spacing, soft background containers, and divide sections with subtle borders or spacing.

üé® Branding / UI Consistency:
Please match our existing UI style:

Fonts:

Headings: League Spartan (600 weight, Semi-Bold)

Body: Lato

Color Palette:

Primary Dark Green: #09261E (called brand)

Brand Light: #135341

Accent (Salmon): #E59F9F

Secondary (Wine): #803344

Background White: #F5F5F5

Black: #1C1C1C

Silver: #D8D8D8

Use font-heading for League Spartan and font-sans for Lato (already configured in Tailwind).

The experience should feel professional, modern, and easy to navigate, with thoughtful use of whitespace and intuitive layouts.

üß† Summary of Files to Add:
/app/reps/page.tsx: The main REPs tabbed directory

/app/rep/[name]/page.tsx: Individual profile for a REP

Reusable component: <RepCard /> for the card layout in the grid

Reusable tabs component (if needed)

Temporary placeholder data for reps to showcase layout

This is a key part of the platform, so make it clean and extensible for future filtering, dynamic data, or CMS integration.
